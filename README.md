access item information from the context of a file

for installation just copy the Vault folder over the Vault folder in your Data Standard environment. Edit the Default.ps1 from the Vault/addinVault folder. Look for the function OnTabContextChanged and add the line OnTabContextChanged_Item in order to have the new code executed whenever a file gets selected.
